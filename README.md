# **Milestone 1 - PulseGym**

## Gym website
<!--Images Here-->
I have created this webpage to showcase the skills I have learned over the first section of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course; this is the first of four projects that I will be creating for the course.
For this project I have chosen to create a web page for a ficticous Gym.
The reason for this selection is that it will allow me to show my abilities to create a static webpage for a commercial entity using html, css and UX design techniques.

## <ins>**UX**</ins>
 
The focus of this website is to showcase the highlights of the Gym, and the many activities that it has. The opening callout section aims to grab the attention of possible new members with a short and punchy about section to inform the user a little about the Gym without overloading them in detail.

This Gym has a particularly large amount of fitness classes, so they have been giving the largest section of the site. The fitness classes have been divided into three different categories so the user can hone in to the type of class they are looking for easily. All the classes have a booking button to allow the user to book a class there and then.

The website is simple to navigate and uses a single page style making navigation with a mobile particularly easy. The font colours are striking but not overwhelming making it clear and attractive to read through the website.
